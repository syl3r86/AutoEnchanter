Welcome to the incredible
# Enchant-o-tron 9001 #

This is a program meant to be used for easy enchanting in a dndgame.
It lets you build up rollable Tables on which different effects can be rolled and then (if aplicable) rolls on any subtable for each rolled Effect.
For each effect and/or table you can specify that only a certain itemkind can be enchanted and/or that a specific gem is required for the effect or table to trigger.
All available Itemkinds are stored in the file itemKinds.txt.
All available Gemkinds are stored in the file gemKinds.txt.
Both are read on start and used for the rest of the enchanting process.

The tables are stored in .xml files.
The program currently tries to load table1.xml and all subtables that are reachable from there.

To enchant an item you simply choose what kind of item and what gem you are using. Then you select which table should be the startingtable and press "enchant!".
And there you have it! you get a new enchanted Item with name and descriptions of all the effects.


Thats it!

Have fun with this cool new Invention.
